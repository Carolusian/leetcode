## IX. Interview Questions

Important chapters: 1-5, 7-10

### Ch 1: Arrays and Strings

Hashtables, ArrayList & Resizable Arrays, StringBuilder

### Ch 2: Linked List

The "Runner" Technique, Recursive Problems (O(n) space where n is depth of recursive)

### Ch 3: Stacks and Queues

Stack: useful in recursive algorithms

#### Good stack problems on leetcode

- [Good stack problems by lee215](https://leetcode.com/problems/online-stock-span/discuss/168311/)
- [Sum of subarray minimums](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-subarray-minimums/discuss/170750/)

### Ch 4: Trees and Graphs

- BFS:
  - typical scenario: find the minimum steps to transform from one state to another
  - example: https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-265/problems/minimum-operations-to-convert-number/
